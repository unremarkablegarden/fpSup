FrameExpos_s (0xC0315C18) was tried first and removed: it fired zero times in

Nothing writes over live code by accident: placement is checked against the
injection cave and against every other span before a byte goes out, because the
last time a probe landed on something that was running it cost four power
cycles to work out why.  `--take` is `mem read`; they are never
issued without being asked for.
