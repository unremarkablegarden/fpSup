"""Package an edition of fpGyroSup for release.

    ./gyro/release_card.py gcsv v1.10a
    ./gyro/release_card.py base v1

Builds the card from source, checks the sections the card is supposed to
carry are really in the binary, and writes the archive and its checksums.
Nothing is assembled by hand: v1.4 of the older line shipped once without its
two orientation sections because a rebuild silently dropped two arguments
somebody had been passing on the command line, and the only visible sign was a
payload container that hashed differently.

# check -- what proves they are aboard is the routine table, below: a zero
# there is exactly the "built but dropped" failure this list exists to catch,
# and it is checked for every routine the blob must carry, not just these.
#
# gyro_drain, stream_claim, stream_commit and stream_flush are NOT here.  They
# had slots while the cave held a pointer to each; hook and body share a blob
# now and the branch is an ordinary `bl`, so a build that dropped one does not
# ship a zero -- it fails to assemble.  Listing them here only made this check
# look for table entries that no longer exist.
