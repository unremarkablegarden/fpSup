"""Create the dedicated writer task, and prove it blocks and wakes.

ORDER MATTERS.  Open last, and only when something is there to use the file.
Opening it and then doing six minutes of other work froze the camera: a file
object nobody is writing to is the \LENS.DAT failure the logger warns about --
"could not be opened again by anything until the camera was power cycled, with
the card light on".

The task is what the audio writer is and ours never was: priority 6, blocked on
tk_slp_tsk rather than polling, woken the instant there is work.  This step
proves only that -- it creates the task, blocks it, and counts wakes.  The ring
and the card write are separate units, because task creation is the piece with
a history of freezing the camera and it should not be entangled with anything
else when it is first run.

The creator runs ONCE, through the shell's borrowed echo handler.  Nothing about
it stays reachable afterwards.
